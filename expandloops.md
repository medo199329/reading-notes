javascript like any other programming languages need their own rules to work, expression and loops are JS way to interact with the computer telling the server how to understand arithmetic equation to help the user, 
when you choose a password or but any number on any website you know it was being able to happen thanks to js which where all the math happen in order to provide an easy experience for the user.

JS deals with highly sophisticated operations and logic for example there are three types of logic gates  minimum in any programming language  OR, AND, NOT
they work together in order to teach the computer how to interact with the user 

they all take TRUE or FALSE inputs for example

| AND &&  | OR   | NOT 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T T=T  | T F=T  | T=F  | 
| T F=F  | T T=T  | F=T  |   
| F T=f   |  F T=T |   |  

in a simple example of them, example (and ) let's say my name is Mohammed **AND** I'm wearing white pants, although my name is Mohammed I don't were white pants.
so if one of them is false then both are false.
 **OR**  on the other hand, if I said my name is Mohammed OR my name is Ahmad, one of them has to be true so if one of the two sentences is true that means the whole phrase is  true.
 how we use those logic gates? by some operators called FOR loop and WHILE loop we can think of them ad repetition commands to tell the computer how many times it should repeat something until it gets it right.


 // program to display numbers from 1 to 5
// initialize the variable
let i = 1, n = 5;

// while loop from i = 1 to 5
while (i <= n) {
    console.log(i);
    i += 1;
}
