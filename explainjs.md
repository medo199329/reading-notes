javascript is like the engine that runs the (HTML&CSS) body we've previously mentioned, JS is a dynamic programming language that tells the website what to do and how to act when the user chooses a specific function or presses a button, JS deals directly with the server. 
consider yourself in a restaurant and you will eat what's in front of you, js, in this case, is the kitchen where the magic happen.

unlike (HTML&CSS) js is a programming language while the other two are text structure and styling editors. other than dynamic websites, it can be used to design simple webgames. 

js rules are called Expressions and operators, sometimes js deals with mathematical simple formulas in order to set the website easily and smooth user experience, 
JS commands the server or the browser to do some functions the user chooses by using special functions called (command) and (prompt).
