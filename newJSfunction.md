as we said before JS is a dynamic language that needs special grammar and rules so it can function properly  JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

this is how function syntax or rules work 
//function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
